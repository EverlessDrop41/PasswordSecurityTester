PasswordSecurityTester
======================
A simple program which takes an input string and then tests it's security based on three things: 
- Numbers 
- Upper case letters
- Lower case letters

It is written in `c++`, htis is mainly because I am attempting to learn C++ at the moment and thought that
this would be a good test exercise
